## 生态学研究中的数据采集方法

::: {.callout-note}
**Observation**
Which species lives here?
How many individuals of each species are there in a community?
What happens if a particular species is removed from a community?
How will organisms respond to climate changes?

**Experimentation**
Designed to test hypotheses by gathering data that support or reject those hypotheses.
Some ecological experiments carefully monitor conditions in selected parts of natural environments (difficult to control variables).
Some ecologists may design artificial environments to carefully control variables in order to test the association of organisms and those variables.

**Modeling**
Many ecological processes, such as climate change, occur over long periods of time or occur over areas as large as our entire planet.
Models help ecologists to understand these phenomenon.
